4. Create your content using this guide
5. Make sure the content builds fine with `npm install && npm run docs:dev`
6. Stage, Commit, and Push your changes
7. Submit a Pull Request (https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol-docs/compare)

All documentation files are stored in the `/docs/src` folder.

## Writing Style

When writing documentation, maintain the following tone & voice:

* **Professional and Authoritative**: Content should maintain a professional tone, suitable for a technical audience.
* **Instructional and Informative**: Writing should aim to educate the reader, with clear instructions and explanations.
* **Impersonal and Objective**: Avoid directly addressing the reader or using personal pronouns. Use passive constructions or neutral phrasing.

## Markdown Features

The documentation supports several markdown features:

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks to delimit code blocks, specifying the language after the first set of backticks:

```python
print('hello world')
```

### Tabs

```markdown
::: tabs
== Tab 1
Content for tab 1

== Tab 2
Content for tab 2
:::
```

### Callouts

The documentation uses GitHub-flavored alerts for callouts:

> [!NOTE]
> Additional information that can almost be ignored, but may be interesting to know.

> [!TIP]
> Useful suggestions and recommended practices. Something you'd tell a friend.

> [!INFO]
> A thing that should probably be told users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Essential information that requires attention. An emphasized note.

> [!WARNING]
> Potential risks or issues to be aware of. Moderate risk.

> [!CAUTION]
> Important considerations that need careful attention. High risk.

> [!DANGER]
> Critical warnings about potentially harmful situations. Critical information.

> [!SUCCESS]
> Indicates a positive outcome or achievement.

```markdown
> [!NOTE/TIP/INFO/...] (Optional) title
> Content
```

### Images and Links

- Links: `[title](link)`
- Images: `![](path/to/image)`
- Images with caption:

```markdown
![](path/to/image)
Some caption{.caption}
```

### Theme-specific Images

You can specify different images for light and dark themes using the `data-theme` attribute:

```markdown
<!-- Image for both themes -->
![Description](./image.png)

<!-- Image for light theme only -->
![Description](./image.png){data-theme="light"}

<!-- Image for dark theme only -->
![Description](./image.png){data-theme="dark"}
```

> [!TIP]
> If there are spaces in the image path, either spaces need to be URL-encded (`%20`), or the following structure can be used (recommended): `![](<path/to/some image>)`

### YouTube Videos

To embed a YouTube video:

```markdown
<YouTubeVideo videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
```


### Quotes

> "Someone said something important and it should be highlighted in the article? Please quote it and attribute it to the initial author."
>  
> _(Author, date, [source](#))_
