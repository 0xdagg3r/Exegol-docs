# Introduction to Contributing

Welcome to the Exegol contribution guide! This section will help you understand how to contribute to the Exegol project.

## Our Philosophy

We are strong advocates of open-source principles. We strive to keep the majority of our code open and accessible—not just because it's the right thing to do, but because we believe in transparency, collaboration, and the power of community.

However, sustaining high-quality open-source software is not effortless. It requires time, skill, and long-term commitment. Too often, open-source is treated as a free resource to be consumed without acknowledgment or contribution. This mindset is not sustainable.

Our model is built to support a healthier, more respectful open-source ecosystem—one where contributors are recognized as essential. Users can give back in two ways: by contributing directly (creating a virtuous cycle of "I use, I contribute"), or by funding the work that keeps the project alive. Either path helps ensure that open-source creators are valued for the real work they do.

Open-source can't thrive if we ignore the human effort behind it. If you benefit from the tools we build, we invite you to be part of that effort—by writing code, sharing knowledge, reporting issues, or subscribing. That's how we keep building, together.

We value all contributions, whether they're code improvements, documentation updates, bug reports, or feature suggestions. Every contribution helps make Exegol better for everyone.
