3. Checkout the `dev` branch
4. (optional) create a new branch in your fork, if you plan on working on different topics
5. Create your content using this guide

7. Stage, Commit, and Push your changes
8. Submit a Pull Request (https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol/compare)

> [!NOTE]
> Considering the wrapper is not the component where people want to contribute most (because that's not where tools are installed, because it may seem a bit complex at first), we don't want to spend time writing documentation most won't ever read. If you DO want to author to the wrapper, please contact us, and we will work with you.
