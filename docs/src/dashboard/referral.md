# Referral program <Badge type="pro" />

The Referral page allows you to participate in Exegol's **referral program** to save on your subscription costs and help friends discover Exegol (and save as well).

The referral program offers mutual benefits:

- Your referred friends get a 10% discount on monthly, or 1.5 months free on yearly Pro plan
- As a referrer, you receive a discount on your next billing cycle for each successful referral. The discounts are cumulative, uncapped, but can't produce a negative billing amount. The discount should be automatically applied to the next billing period.

The referral program is available only to users with an active Pro subscription.

1. Click the "Refer a friend" button in the referrals table
