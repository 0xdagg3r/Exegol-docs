# Overview

The dashboard ([dashboard.exegol.com](https://dashboard.exegol.com)) is your main entry point to access and manage your Exegol instances (i.e., subscriptions, licenses, learning center, referral, community and support links, etc.).

The dashboard overview provides a quick summary of your account, subscriptions, licenses, and useful links and is mostly useful for paid tiers users: <Badge type="pro"/> and <Badge type="enterprise"/>.
