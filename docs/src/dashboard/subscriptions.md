# Subscriptions

The Subscriptions page allows you to manage your **Exegol** <Badge type="pro" /> subscriptions (Pro subs only), view usage details, and handle billing information.

The <Badge type="enterprise" /> subs are detailed in the [Organizations](organizations#subscriptions) page.

> [!TIP]
> Additional fields can be shown through the "View" options menu, especially for debug purposes if something doesn't work and you reach out to Support.

The price shown is the default price of the corresponding subscription tier, not including potential discounts. The real amount is available in the billing portal.

The billing portal link can be obtained through the Actions menu in the far right column of the table. Through this portal, users can modify billing information, number of seats, cancel subcriptions etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Pro subscriptions are limited to 1 subscription with up to 2 seats. If you need more seats, consider upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

## Adding a New Subscription

To add a new subscription:

1. Click the "Add subscription" button in the top-right corner
2. You'll be redirected to the subscription page where you can choose between Pro and Enterprise plans

> [!WARNING]
> If you already have a Pro subscription, you'll see a warning message indicating that you've reached the limit. You can either:
