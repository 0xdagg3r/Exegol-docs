## Account Deletion

Account deletion requests are currently processed manually by our team to ensure proper handling of active subscriptions before account closure. This prevents you from being locked out while subscriptions are still active. This process will be automated as we scale up.

Once processed, account deletion is permanent. All your data, including subscriptions, licenses, and settings will be permanently removed.
